            I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the UChicago DSI Summer Lab 
            under the mentorship of Marshini Chetty, Nick Feamster, and Chenhao Tan.

            Broadly, I am interested in Computational Social Science. Specifically, I am 
            interested in studying misinformation, divisive language, political polarization, 
            and in general, ways in which information and the way it is communicated 
            can divide people.
