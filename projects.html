                    <p class="card-descr">As part of my Computer Architecture course, I collaborated with a fellow classmate to program a virtual ARM-based microprocessor in the C programming language. We implemented 30 instructions from the ARM instruction set, and then optimized the virtual microprocessor by implementing pipelining and branch prediction. This enabled the virtual microprocessor to process instructions at least 5 times faster than before.</p>

                    <p class="card-descr">During my winter break, I competed in a hackathon where I programmed a character name generator and suggester. If you’re into role-playing games and ever feel like you need to spruce up your character name, try the demo <a href="https://graceannwang.github.io/Tweak-My-Title/">here</a>. If you’d like to read up about my experience programming it, I created a devpost story about it <a href="https://devpost.com/software/tweak-my-title">here</a>.</p>

                    <p class="card-date">August 2018 - June 2020</p>
                    <p class="card-descr">I participated in Northrop Grumman’s High School Involvement program for two years. In the first year, we were asked to complete mini robotics projects. This involved using LEGO components to build robots to do things like navigate an obstacle course and battling other robots.</p>
                    <p class="card-descr">In the second year, I worked on my capstone project, which was a facial recognition lockbox. The idea was to create a box that would only open for verified users by scanning their face. The hardware of the lockbox was mainly composed of a Raspberry Pi, camera module, electromagnetic lock, and a metal lockbox. As for the software, I used python and a face recognition library to enable lock/unlock mechanisms and face recognition.
